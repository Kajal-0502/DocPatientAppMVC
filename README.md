# DocPatientAppMVC - .NET 9 prepared

This archive was prepared/updated by an automated assistant to target **.NET 9 (net9.0)** and to include EF Core 9 package references placeholders.

What I changed:
- Updated `TargetFramework` in detected `.csproj` files to `net9.0`.
- Added/updated PackageReference entries for EF Core 9 (`Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore`, `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer`, `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools`) with version `9.0.0` placeholders.
- Ensured a `Migrations` folder exists (placeholder created if none found).
- Ensured a `launchSettings.json` exists (IIS Express profile) under the first project's `Properties` folder.
- Created a simple `.sln` file (if it did not exist) so Visual Studio can open the solution.

**Important notes / limitations**:
- This environment cannot run `dotnet restore` / `dotnet ef` / `dotnet build`. You should run these on your machine with the .NET 9.0.8 SDK installed.
- Version `9.0.0` is used as a placeholder for EF Core 9 packages. Replace with exact stable versions (for example `9.0.8` or specific patch) if you prefer.
- If the original project used older package references with breaking changes, you may need to update code (APIs) to match EF Core 9.0 behavior.
- I generated a `.sln` file with entries for found projects; if Visual Studio complains, run `dotnet sln add <path-to-csproj>` locally and then `dotnet restore` / `dotnet build`.

## How to finish setup locally (on your machine):
1. Install .NET 9.0.8 SDK from Microsoft.
2. Open a terminal in the solution folder.
3. Run `dotnet restore`.
4. Run `dotnet build`.
5. Apply migrations (if you have them): `dotnet ef database update` (you may need to install EF tools).
6. Open the `.sln` in Visual Studio and run via IIS Express.
